<h2>Difference Between Class and ID</h2>
<p>A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:</p>

<!-- An element with a unique id -->
<h1 id="myHeader">My Cities</h1>

<!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>

<!-- Class	vs Id
We can apply a class to various elements so that it could be numerous times on a single page.
	The Id is unique in a page, and we can only apply it to one specific element.
The class is assigned to an element and its name starts with "." followed by the name of the class.	
The name of the Id starts with the "#" symbol followed by a unique id name.
We can attach multiple class selectors to an element.
	We can attach only one ID selector to an element.
Syntax:
.class{
// declarations of CSS
}	Syntax:
#id{
// declarations of CSS
